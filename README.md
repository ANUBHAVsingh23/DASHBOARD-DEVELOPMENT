## Task 3: Interactive Sales Dashboard Development with Tableau

### Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize and analyze sales data. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance across different dimensions such as region, state, product categories, and time, demonstrating data visualization and dashboard development skills.

### Visualizations Included

The dashboard comprises the following interactive visualizations:

*   **Top 10 State Sales based on Region:** A bar chart showcasing the top 10 states by sales, filtered by region. This allows for quick identification of top-performing states within each region.

*   **Comparison based upon Sales, Profit and Sub Categories:** A scatter plot comparing Sales and Profit across different Sub-Categories. This visualization helps to understand the relationship between sales and profit for various product sub-categories, and identify outliers.

*   **Year wise Sales and Profit:** A line chart showing the trend of Sales and Profit over the years. This visualization provides a temporal view of business performance and growth trends.

*   **Product name & Sub Categories V/s Sales:** A packed bubbles chart visualizing Sales by Product Name and Sub-Category. The size of the bubbles represents the sales volume, and the color represents the Sub-Category, providing a visual hierarchy and category-based comparison.
